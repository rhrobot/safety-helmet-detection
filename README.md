An online safety helmet detection experiment was conducted on the Jetson AGX Xavier device, and the detection results were pushed through an RTSP stream and displayed, as shown in the attachment. The image acquisition frequency was set at 25 FPS, and the algorithm accurately detected both helmet-wearing and non-helmet-wearing instances, fulfilling the online detection requirements for on-site safety helmet detection systems. The proposed method effectively detects the wearing statuses of safety helmets in real-world scenarios while meeting the imposed detection accuracy, speed, and deployment demands.
